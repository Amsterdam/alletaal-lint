    longDescription: |
      alletaal-lint is a Dutch text readability assessment tool based on the LiNT 
      (Leesbaarheids­instrument voor Nederlandse Teksten) methodology. It provides 
      automated scoring of Dutch text readability using linguistic features such as 
      word frequency, syntactic complexity, content word density, and concreteness.
      
      The tool is designed to help content creators, editors, and organizations 
      evaluate and improve the accessibility of their Dutch text content. It 
      provides readability scores on a scale of 1-4, where 1 represents very 
      difficult text and 4 represents easy-to-read text.
      
      Key features include:
      - Sentence-level and document-level readability analysis
      - REST API for integration with other systems
      - Command-line interface for batch processing
      - Multiple output formats for different use cases
      - Based on scientific research and validated methodology
      
      The tool is based on research from Gebruiker Centraal and builds upon the 
      T-Scan project from the Centre for Digital Humanities at Utrecht University.
